  # README Generator 
  ## Description
  The README Generator will generate a high quality, professional README file in markdown, based on the user’s inputs. I built this application in order to assist me in my efforts to become a full stack developer as a professional looking README file is as important as a good git profile. It was built using node.js and the fs and inquirer packages. This was a good opportunity to understand how to write files to the file system as well as how to efficiently perform q&a with a user.
